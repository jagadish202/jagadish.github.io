            <p> Indian space research organisation (ISRO) has shared the new images captured by by the Lander Position Detection Camera (LPDC) from an altitude of about 70 km, on August 19, 2023. These marvellous pictures give more glimpses of the dark side of the Moon where the lander 'Vikram' is scheduled to land on August 23, 2023 at 6:02 pm IST.
            ISRO shared these images on its official channel on X (formerly Twitter). It further said LPDC images will assist the Lander Module in determining its position (latitude and longitude) by matching them against an onboard moon reference map.</p>

            In the post, ISRO said , “The mission is on schedule. Systems are undergoing regular checks. Smooth sailing is continuing.”</p>
